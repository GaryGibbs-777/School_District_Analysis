# School_District_Analysis
The point of this analysis is to help give insights to someone that works for a school district, named Maria. Some of the grades here will be replaced with NaN's (Not a Number) and keeping the rest as is. In grades 9 to 12. The analysis will show what the test results from are from all of the schools in this district when Thomas High School's 9th to 12th grade student scores are removed from math and reading subjects.

# Deliverable 1:
The loc method was used to select all of the reading and math scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School. Within the loc method logical operators and comparisons were used to attain data from the reading_score and math_score columns, and were replaced with nan. As seen below

Deliverable 2:
After subtracting the total student count by the number of 9th graders at Thomas High School from the total number of students in the district, then recalculating the passing math and reading percentages and overall passing percentages. As seen below.
